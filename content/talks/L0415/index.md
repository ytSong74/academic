## Information of the Speaker 
**Walid G. Aref, Purdue University** 

Walid G. Aref got his Ph.D. from UMD in 1993. His research interests are in
extending the functionality of database systems in support of emerging
applications, e.g., spatial, spatio- temporal, graph, biological, and sensor
databases. He is also interested in query processing, indexing, data
streaming, and geographic information systems (GIS). Walid’s research has
been supported by the National Science Foundation, the National Institute of
Health, Purdue Research Foundation, CERIAS, Panasonic, and Microsoft Corp. In
2001, he received the CAREER Award from the National Science Foundation and
in 2004, he received a Purdue University Faculty Scholar award. Walid is a
member of Purdue’s CERIAS. He is the Editor-in-Chief of the ACM Transactions
of Spatial Algorithms and Systems (ACM TSAS), an editorial board member of
the Journal of Spatial Information Science (JOSIS), and has served as an
editor of the VLDB Journal and the ACM Transactions of Database Systems (ACM
TODS). Walid has won several best paper awards including the 2016 VLDB
ten-year best paper award. He is a Fellow of the IEEE, and a member of the
ACM. Between 2011 and 2014, Walid has served as the chair of the ACM Special
Interest Group on Spatial Information (SIGSPATIAL).

Walid acknowledges the support of the National Science Foundation under Grant
Numbers III-1815796 and IIS-1910216.

**Ahmed R. Mahmood, Google LLC**

Ahmed R. Mahmood is a software engineer at Google LLC. Ahmed is a member of
the F1 Query team working on scalable query processing and spatial data
management. Ahmed got his Ph.D. at the Department of Computer Science, Purdue
University. His research interests included scalable data management,
distributed stream processing, and spatial-keyword data processing.

## Abstract
The widespread use of GPS-enabled cellular devices, i.e., smart phones, led
to the popularity of numerous mobile applications, e.g., social networks,
micro-blogs, mobile web search, and crowd-powered reviews. These applications
generate large amounts of geo-tagged textual data, i.e., spatial-keyword
data. This data needs to be processed and queried at an unprecedented scale.
This has led to the development of various scalable spatial-keyword
processing systems. These systems are designed to ingest, store, index, and
query massive amounts of spatial-keyword data. We present recent research
efforts in the area of scalable spatial-keyword processing. We describe the
main models for scalable spatial-keyword processing, and list the popular
spatial-keyword queries. Then, we present the approaches that have been
adopted in scalable spatial-keyword processing systems with special attention
to data indexing, adaptive data partitioning, and query processing.
