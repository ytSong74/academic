## Information of the Speaker 
 **Ahmed Eldawy, University of California Riverside** 
 
Ahmed Eldawy is an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at the University of California Riverside. His research interests lie in the broad area of databases with a focus on big data management and spatial data processing. Ahmed is the main inventor of SpatialHadoop, the most comprehensive open source system for big spatial data management. Ahmed has many collaborators in industrial research labs including Microsoft Research and IBM Watson. He was awarded the Quality Metrics Fellowship in 2016, Doctoral Dissertation Fellowship in 2015, and Best Poster Runner-up award in ICDE 2014. His work is supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).

## Abstract
There has been a dramatic increase in the amount of publicly available data provided by governments, non-governmental organizations, and industry. According to numereous studies, at least 60% of this data has a spatial component. Therefore, there is a pressing need to explore and utilize this data in data science applications. The first part of this talk describes the architecture of SpatialHadoop, an end-to-end system for big spatial data processing. SpatialHadoop consists of four main layers, distributed storage, MapReduce processing, visualization, and high-level query language. The second part of the talk will focus on the recent efforts made to extend that architecture to support interactive data exploration for domain scientists who work with big spatio-temporal data.
