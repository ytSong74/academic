## Abstract
Maps services (e.g., routing and store finding) are ubiquitous in widely used applications including navigation systems, ride sharing, and items/food delivery. There are plenty of efforts dedicated to supporting such services through designing more efficient algorithms, e.g., efficient shortest path and range queries. We believe that efficiency is no longer a bottleneck to these map services. Instead, it is the accuracy of the underlying road network and query result. In this talk, we present QARTA, an open-source full-fledged system for highly accurate and scalable map services. QARTA employs machine learning techniques to construct its own highly accurate map, not only in terms of map topology but more importantly, in terms of edge weights. QARTA also employs machine learning techniques to calibrate its query answers based on contextual information, including transportation modality, location, and time of day/week.
