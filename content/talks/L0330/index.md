## Information of the Speaker 
**Ibrahim Sabek, MIT** 
 
 Dr. Sabek is a Postdoctoral Associate at MIT. Before that, he got
his PhD and M.Sc. in computer science from the University of Minnesota,
Twin Cities. His research interests broadly include machine learning
for systems, scalable data processing, and querying, probabilistic
databases, scalable knowledge base construction, and big spatial data
management and analysis.  Dr. Sabek has been named an NSF Computing
Innovation Fellow (CIFellow) in 2020, and awarded the University of
Minnesota Doctoral Dissertation Fellowship in 2019 for his
dissertation focused on scalable machine learning for big spatial data
and applications. His research work has won the first place in the ACM
SIGSPATIAL Student Research Competition (SRC) 2019, and has been
nominated for the Best Paper Award of ACM SIGSPATIAL 2018.

## Abstract
The proliferation in amounts of generated data has propelled
the rise of scalable machine learning solutions to efficiently analyze
and extract useful insights from such data. Meanwhile, spatial data
has become ubiquitous, e.g., GPS data, with increasingly sheer sizes
in recent years. The applications of big spatial data span a wide
spectrum of interests including tracking infectious disease, climate
change simulation, drug addiction, among others. Consequently, major
research efforts are exerted to support efficient analysis and
intelligence inside these applications by either providing spatial
extensions to existing machine learning solutions or building new
solutions from scratch. In this talk, we comprehensively review the
state-of-the-art work in the intersection of machine learning and big
spatial data. We cover existing research efforts and challenges in
this intersection via a thorough landscape. We also discuss the
existing end-to-end systems, and highlight their main properties and
limitations.
