## Abstract
Traffic prediction plays an essential role in intelligent
transportation systems. Accurate traffic prediction can assist traffic
management, route planning and assignment, and congestion
mitigation. This problem is challenging due to the complex and dynamic
spatio-temporal dependencies between different regions of the road
network. Extensive studies have been done in this area, proposing
techniques ranging from classical statistical methods to modern
machine learning especially deep learning models. In this guest
lecture, we will discuss recent developments in this area, with a
focus on deep learning models for traffic prediction.
