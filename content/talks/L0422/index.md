## Abstract
Using other fellow travelers and their cars as a means of
transportation has been around for many decades, known as carpooling
in the 20th century. In recent times, resurgence of this line of thought in the
form of ride-sharing has become popular. We will first discuss
classical and new ways of using the crowd as a means of transportation. We will
then further discuss what ride-sharing truly means and how to represent
it as a graph problem and present some solutions. We will extend this
shared-economy-based line of thought for the coming era of
connected-autonomous vehicles and beyond, and also consider transporting
goods as well as people. We focus on spatio-temporal aspects of this
hot area of research and show why the associated graph problems are
hard to solve and how they relate to other problems in graphs.
